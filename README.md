# DynamicsMigrationTool


@Tanguy - FYI about XRMToolbox website - On https://www.xrmtoolbox.com/profile/ I am asked to confirm my email, which links me to https://www.xrmtoolbox.com/Account/Manage/ConfirmEmailRequest and a message saying "Check your email for confirmation instructions.", however the confirmation email never seems to get sent through to my gmail address. May be related to my email address not being the same as my login credentials? Unclear how else to get in contact with you about this.
